    "text": "Course Structure\nThe course consists of lectures introducing each week’s content and an R script that provides hands-on coding examples for the content, including videos of yours truly going through the content.\nAt the beginning of the course, students are encouraged to form groups based on research interests and general vibes. I require each student group to check in with me to report their progress (even if there’s nothing to report – no progress, no big deal). This does not count towards any grade but rather serves the purpose of me receiving feedback on the learning experience (this is a new course!) and hopefully helps me with providing more appropriate guidance.\nHere’s an overview of the topics covered:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWEEK\nTITLE\nCONTENT\nINFORMAL TITLE\n\n\n\n\n1\nWHAT IS CSS?\nHousekeeping; Getting to know each other and your research interests; Data management; RStudio stuff; Python environment; Git(?); Scientific Computing\nWhatever you want to know about CSS\n\n\n2\nNew possibilities\nREGEX\nREGEXES - tame your data\n\n\n3\ndata acquisition I\nrvest (R); selenium (Python); APIs\nstealing data from websites without them noticing it\n\n\n4\ndata acquisition II\nOCR; OpenAI Whisper\nmaking the computer your transcription servant\n\n\n5\ntext as data I\nbag of words: dictionary, tfidf, ner/pos\nbasic text analysis\n\n\n6\ntext as data II\nsupervised + unsupervised ML\nadvanced text analysis\n\n\n7\ntext as data III\nvector space; embeddings\ncutting-edge text analysis\n\n\n8\ntext as data VI\nBERT/GPT/NLI\nholy shit…text analysis\n\n\n9\nadvanced techniques: geo data I\ngeo visualization\nmapping human behavior in space\n\n\n10\nadvanced techniques: geo data II\nweights, autocorrelation, regression\nchecking out what drives human behavior in space\n\n\n11\nadvanced techniques: simulation I\nABMs - setup\nsimulating human behavior\n\n\n12\nadvanced techniques: simulation II\nABMs - empirically calibrated\nsimulating human behavior - but with more empirical realism\n\n\n13\npaper presentations\npaper presentations\nshow me your work"
